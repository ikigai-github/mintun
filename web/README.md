# Mintun Tool

This tool is aimed at providing a creator friendly means of making blockchain assets and events. This includes things like creating and managing collections, collection groups, tickets, airdrops, and more. It will also include some guides to help explain some of the nomenclature in laymans terms.

A creator will be able to link to a collection view to display details of collections they created with the tool. This can be used to show customers the constraints they have applied to their constracts as well as all the assets in the collection. This tool will be publicly available and free to use with no plans for any form of monetization.

## Current Task List
